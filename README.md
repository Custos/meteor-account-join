# Accounts Merge
This does the following
1) When a user logs in from new service, check to see if that email is associated with any other meteor accounts.
2) If email is associated, prompt for password, or to launch one of associated services to validate authenticity.
3) If successful authentication, add service to existing account.

4) If user is logged in, allow user to associate their account with any other service by initiating a login, this would include different emails.
